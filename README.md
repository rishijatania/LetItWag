# LetItWag

**Description**

• Let It Wag, a project built in JAVA Swing framework using the combination of Singleton and Factory Design Patterns.

• The core concept of the project was the ability to report stray pets across geographical areas and being able to monitor their status after they are taken into shelter homes.

• To make it a feature-rich application, we implemented Splash Screen, JBrowser for consuming Google Maps location features, JFreeCharts for visualization of analytical data, JavaMail for Email using SMTP, Log4J for logging all user and system actions and DB40 database model to store the data with proper validation and authenticity.

• Apart from this, the system had over 18 user roles spanning across multiple networks involving 8 major workflows and was capable to handle multiple employees spanning across the ecosystem, from the user to the pet shelter office administration and field workers. It also had the ability for the pet shelter to access supply chain and medical facilities on a work-request basis.
